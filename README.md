Water Storage Web Application
This is a web application that calculates the units of water stored between blocks and visually represents the solution using an SVG shape. The application is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# How to Use
Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Enter the block heights in the input field. Each block height should be separated by a comma (,). For example: 0,4,0,0,0,6,0,6,4,0.

Click the "Calculate" button.

The units of water stored and the visual representation will be displayed below.

# Output
The output consists of two main sections:

Visual Representation: The blocks are represented as gray rectangles, and the water between the blocks is represented by a blue-colored shape. The height and width of the shapes correspond to the block heights and the calculated water units, respectively.

Water Units: The calculated units of water stored are displayed as text below the visual representation.
